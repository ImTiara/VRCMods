# _ImmersiveTouch_
- ImmersiveTouch provides haptic feedback in your VR controllers when your hands interacts with objects (meshes) or dynamic bones.
This mod is _universal within VRChat_ and will run ontop of other mods that provides dynamic bone interactions with other players
such as MultiplayerDynamicBones or emmVRC's Global Dynamic Bones.
The vibrations are speed dependent which means stroking hairs/tails etc feels very nice.


# _GestureIndicator_
- If you ever used Index controllers, you may know how unreliable the finger tracking can be.
This causes all kinds of awkward issues when you try to express yourself in front of someone without looking at a mirror.
Gesture Indicator displays on the HUD which gestures you are currently doing.
The text colors, transparency & positions can be customizable to your likings!


# _NoPerformanceStats_
- This mod disables the avatar performance scanning and will make (RAM) cached avatars load instantly.
Non-cached avatars will also load a bit faster and should decrease the lag spikes when someone changes their avatar.
Please be aware that this will cause issues with safety features such as "performance blocking". 

# _DragFix_
- DragFix forces the "UI Drag Threshold" (the distance you need to move your cursor before it actually starts dragging) to match your current avatar's scale.
This fixes the issue where you are almost / fully unable to scroll menus while using a tiny avatar, or making the new QuickMenu easier to scroll in.
DragFix also comes with individual settings for Desktop/VR drag thresholds (a value such as 0.1 is recommended for Desktop and a value of 1.0 for VR).
