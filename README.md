_This is a complete collection of my VRChat mods._
(My mods were previously in separate repositories which was generally a bad idea)

# _ImmersiveTouch_
With this mod you will receive vibrations in your VR controllers when hand colliders interact with dynamic bones.
This mod should work with other mods that allows you to interact with peoples dynamic bones such as "MultiplayerDynamicBones".
The vibrations are speed dependent which means stroking hairs/tails etc feels very nice.
Please note that the avatar you are wearing requires hand colliders for this mod to function correctly.


# _GestureIndicator_
If you ever used Index controllers, you may know how unreliable the finger tracking can be.
This causes major issues when you try to express yourself in front of someone without looking at a mirror.
Gesture Indicator displays on the HUD which gestures you are currently doing.


# _NoPerformanceStats_
This mod disables the avatar performance scanning and will make (RAM) cached avatars load instantly.
Non-cached avatars will also load a bit faster and should decrease the lag spikes when someone changes their avatar.
This mod is built using MelonPreferences so it's highly recommended to use UIExpansionKit with it.
