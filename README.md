# **End of support**
VRChat has ceased support for the wholesome modding community by introducing EAC (Easy Anti-Cheat) & therefore i've made the decision to quit VRChat modding entirely.
Instead, I have moved over to [ChilloutVR](https://store.steampowered.com/app/661130/ChilloutVR/) (Check out my CVR mods [here](https://github.com/ImTiara/CVRMods)!)
Don't worry, VRChat has taken our mod ideas and actively working on implementing them into the game itself (Gesture Indicator & Immersive Touch)!
Thank you all who have used and enjoyed my mods & thank you all who contributed to this repository <3

# _ImmersiveTouch_
- ImmersiveTouch provides a satisfying haptic feedback in your VR controllers when your hands interacts with objects (meshes).
The vibrations are speed dependent which means stroking hairs/tails etc feels very nice.


# _GestureIndicator_
- If you ever used Index controllers, you may know how unreliable the finger tracking can be.
This causes all kinds of awkward issues when you try to express yourself in front of someone without looking at a mirror.
Gesture Indicator displays on the HUD which gestures you are currently doing.
The text colors, transparency & positions can be customizable to your likings!


# _NoPerformanceStats_
- This mod disables the avatar performance scanning and will make (RAM) cached avatars load instantly.
Non-cached avatars will also load a bit faster and should decrease the lag spikes when someone changes their avatar.
Please be aware that this will cause issues with safety features such as "performance blocking". 

# _DragFix_
- DragFix forces the "UI Drag Threshold" (the distance you need to move your cursor before it actually starts dragging) to match your current avatar's scale.
This fixes the issues where scrolling for example in the new QuickMenu can be difficult depending on your avatar size.
DragFix also comes with individual settings for Desktop/VR drag thresholds (a value such as 0.1 is recommended for Desktop and a value of 1.0 for VR).
